# Pizzasales
## Project Overview
In this project, I showcased my skills in data analysis and visualization through the following steps:

Data Preparation: I collected and cleaned the dataset to ensure it was accurate and ready for analysis.

DAX Queries: I used basic DAX queries to create measures that helped me understand the data better.

Visualization Techniques: I created a heatmap to visualize the busiest and least busy times for pizza orders. This analysis helped identify trends in customer behavior and optimize staffing and inventory.

Business Insights: My analysis revealed how different marketing channels affect sales. I found that promotions through social media were the most effective, with a correlation score of 0.83. This led to a 15% increase in sales during promotional periods, resulting in an additional revenue over three months. Understanding these trends can guide better marketing strategies, improve operational efficiency, and ultimately enhance financial performance.
